# clock
Made a digital clock with different images, expressions, and more. 

# Instructions 
There are no instructions for the application, I wanted to use it as a desktop screensaver and leave it open on Chrome. If you reload the page it will prompt a different image and will greet you different messages/images for different times. 

# Built With
-HTML 
-CSS
-JS

# Overview
I made this clock to test my JS skills as a beginner trying to understand setting up variables, and using if and elseif statements. It was a great challenge as I got to see how I can connect certain messages and photos to certain times.
